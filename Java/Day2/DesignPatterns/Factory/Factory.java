     * FACTORY
     *      -> you don't instantiate - the factory does 
     *      -> you have one general class or interface with a bunch of child objects 
     *         and rather than your main class depending on ALL the child objects, it only depends on the factory
     *      -> this is a direct correlation to the idea of coupling and cohesion
     * 
     * 
     * COUPLING vs COHESION
     *      -> cohesion refers to relationships within your classes
     *          - low cohesion means that a class performs many different things
     *          - high cohesion means that your class is focused on a specific set of tasks
     * 
     *      -> coupling refers to relationshps between different classes
     *          - low coupling means youre dependent on few classes
     *          - high coupling means youre very dependent on many classes
     * 
     *      In code: we want HIGH COHESION and LOW COUPLING
